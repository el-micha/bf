-- brainfuck interpreter

-- read file, tokenize it, check its well-formedness
-- this gives a list of instructions
-- needs a pointer, just as the tape needs a pointer

-- datatype tape with pointer with interface:
-- move pointer, read from pointer, write to pointer (input and output to and from pointer)

-- state of program is (tdata, tinstr) which will transition to (tdata', tinstr') after the instruction at the pointer of tinstr.
-- 

-- TODO: Instruction a type which is represented by the 8 bf chars, but also is a state transformer on the (dtape, itape) tuple
